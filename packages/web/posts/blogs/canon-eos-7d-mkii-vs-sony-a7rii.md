Am I out of mind?  Why on earth would I compare a wildlife/sport/action camera (EOS 7D MKII) with a camera mainly designed for landscape photography (Sony A7rII)?  There is very little in common between the two.

It is true that the 7D MKII and A7rII are different animals.  The former has a 20M-pixel a crop sensor and can shoot continuously at 10fps.  Sony A7rII on the hand employs a 42M-pixel full frame sensor but can only shoot at 5fps continuously.  7D MKII not only shoots faster, it also excels in AF tracking, a critical feature in sport and wildlife photography.
