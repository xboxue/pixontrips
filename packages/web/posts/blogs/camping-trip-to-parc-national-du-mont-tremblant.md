[The grandiose group camping tradition](http://pixontrips.com/blogs/camping-at-murphys/) has become even more popular this year.  The event on the Civic long weekend has attracted over 90 participants ranging from kids of few years old to seniors in their 80s.

The abundance of photography opportunities is a big draw for me.  I couldn't wait to test the Olympus OM-D EM1 mkII and the Zuiko 40-150mm f2.8 lens, a light weight and splash-proof combo that should allow me to take wildlife photos while paddling in a kayak.

In my camera bag, I also packed a Sony A7rII, Tamron 15mm-30 f2.8 lens and EF200mm f2.8L.

We camped at the Castor campground by Le Lac Monroe in the Diable section of the park.

**2018 08 05** Woke up at 5:40AM, the misty lake was not what I expected but it didn't disappoint me.  Photos of Adirondack deck chairs on a lake dock have proliferated in social media, The mist conveys the tranquility of the lake.

After getting enough shots of the dock and chairs, I started exploring the park on my bicycle.  On the way to the discovery centre I spotted the deers enjoying the early morning on a side road that leads to another campground,.  I hastily threw the bike to the ground, took out the camera, swapped the 15-30mm lens with the EF200mm f2.8L and adjusted the settings to ISO640 and f2.8.  When everything is ready, I slowly walked towards the cross-road so I could see the deers.  I kept myself as low as possible not to make the deers threatened.  Even at the widest aperture shutter speed was merely 1/60 second.  A7rII's in-camera image stabilization was essential in keep the image sharp.

Highlight of the day was les Méandres de la Diable, canoeing and kayaking on the Diable River.  The 1080P slow-mo video was shot hand-held using the little OM-D E1 Mark II camera paired with a Zuiko 12-40mm f2.8 lens.  OM-D E1 Mark II's incredible stabilization ability is very evident in the video.  The camera also did a good job in tracking the subject in video mode.

**2018 08 06** Heavy down pour at dawn dashed the hope of seeming sunrise.  At 7:00AM sky started to clear up, not too late heading to lake side dock.

We didn't waste any time to paddle on Lake Monroe before heading home.

Two loons came into sight.  Time to test the 40-150mm lens!  I quietly followed the loons while keeping a 15-meter distance suggested by the Sepeq.   The loons were having fun on the lake.  From time to time they would dive into water and came out after a while.  I got the best shots when they surfaced right beside my kayak.  The sound of the shutter is music to my ears when firing at 15 frames per second.  C-AF + tracking also worked like a charm, admittedly, this was not bird-in-fly.  I was blown away by the sharpness of the 40-150mm lens when viewing the photos on a 27" Dell Ultrasharp monitor at 100% zoom.  My benchmarks are Canon EF100-400mm f4-5.6L and EF500mm f4L IS lenses.  Under optimal conditions the two Canon lens can be extremely sharp, but I seemed to have better chance of getting sharp images using the Olympus combo.

Close to shoreline there were many other birds.

After spending an hour and half on the lake, it is time to go back home.
