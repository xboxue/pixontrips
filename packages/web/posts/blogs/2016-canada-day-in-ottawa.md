This year, Canada Day landed conveniently on a Friday, which meant a long weekend. We were tempted to go camping somewhere, but celebrations of the country in Ottawa are a real shame to miss out on, especially when the weather was as nice as it was this first of July.

Despite many attempts, I was only able to capture this one video of Snowbird jets, as it was so difficult to predicate where exactly they would show up.

It took me half hour to get out of the crowd in the Parliament Hill area.  At one point, I was even concerned about getting trampled.

As always, I enjoyed celebrating Canada Day in the capital and am fortunate to call this country home.
