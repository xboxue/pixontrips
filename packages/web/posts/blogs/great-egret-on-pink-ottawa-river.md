I was awake at 4:30AM and could not sleep anymore.  Jeffrey posted a few really nice Green Heron shots taken at Andrew Haydon Park on a WeChat birding group.  Maybe I will have some luck today.  Headed out at 5:30AM, arrived at Andrew Haydon Park when it was still dark.

A blue Heron was wading in the river not too far from shore.  While I was concentrating on the Heron, a great egret swung by out of blue.  The egret stole my full attention.

The great egret was active, it waded around and flew over to another close-by spot now and then.  At around 6:30AM, the great egret landed at a spot where the water was reflecting the pink colour of the early morning sky.

A minute later, it took off again.

EOS7D MKII delivered at this very moment.  Auto focus tracks nicely despite the 1.4x tele-converter and challenging lighting condition.

The egret perched on a rock that emerged out of the water.  What a poetic scene!

Three minutes later, off the egret went.

I managed to catch up to get a couple of shots.

Two seconds after taking the photo above, the great egret flew away.
