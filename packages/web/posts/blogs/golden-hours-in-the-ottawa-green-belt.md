Winter is not always bitter and miserable.  The past Sunday was wonderfully warm and sunny.  By late afternoon the sky became a bit overcast, and the soft but bright light was excellent for shooting wildlife.  Mrs Trips and I went to [Shirley's Bay](http://ofnc.ca/birding/wheretogo/index.html#Shi), a popular location for birding in the Ottawa west end.

After scouting the site, I decided to set up my camera and tripod so an object was in a backlit situation. I was busy shooting chickadees, all of a sudden this big pileated woodpecker (see the above featured photo) swooped down and perched on a birch tree.  I quickly pointed my camera, an A7RII + Canon EF100-400mm f4.5-5.6L to the bird and switched the camera to custom defined action mode.  Granted A7RII is not an action camera by any means, with a Metabones T smart adaptor, focusing speed is not fast but works, even at 400mm.

In Lightroom, the shadow was boosted slightly to reveal the fine details of the black feather.  Sony's A7RII really shines here, no visible increase in shadow noise after boosting.

We were about to pack and leave, then some unexpected visitors came.  It was close to sunset, so the deers must be hungry.  They went straight to food that people put out to feed the birds.

With the camera still on tripod, I pointed it to a direction that nothing was intruding in the foreground.  When the deer gave me a good pose, I clicked the button.  Wildlife fashion show!
