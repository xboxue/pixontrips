Weather on Sunday March 20th was fabulous.  It was a bit cool but not enough to deter my temptation to go out.

I drove to Huntmar drive in Kanata, a suggested birding site according to the [Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club website](http://ofnc.ca/birding/wheretogo/index.html#Hun).  Huntmar is too narrow and too busy, it is unsafe to park the car along the side of the road.

The excitement from [last week](http://pixontrips.com/2016/03/14/golden-hours-in-the-ottawa-green-belt/) was calling me to go back to Shirleys Bay, I didn't hesitate for a second. 15 minutes later, I arrived at the Hilda bird feeder located at Shirleys Bay.

A group of 3 photographers were there chatting.  Apparently, nothing exciting was happening.  The rest of the afternoon was uneventful, except that one of the photographers turns out to be Rudy Pohl, an Ottawa wildlife and nature photographer.  Here is his personal website and his flickr site:
