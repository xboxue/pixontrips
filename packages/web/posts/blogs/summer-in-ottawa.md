Usually by this time of the year (Civic long weekend) we'd be camping somewhere to enjoy the hot days of summer.  We stayed in town this year, went to see the Buskerfest in downtown Ottawa near sunset, hoping the golden light will do its magic in getting us some good photos.

Sparks street, the venue of the Buskerfest was completely in shadow, there is nothing magic here.   In fact, the light was flat and dim, I had to crank up ISO to 1250 to be able to hand held the camera steady.  The show was interesting, the crowd was amused,  but the best photos I could get were a few sharp snapshots.  It is better to move on.

Rideau Canal has been my favourite local subject.  From the Mackenzie King Bridge looking north, you can see the well known historical Ottawa landmarks.  Underneath the bridge is the Rideau Canal, to the left from near to far are the National Arts Centre and Parliament Hills.   Shaw Centre is next to the bridge on the right and Chateau Laurier stands in the distance.

The glowing sky after sunset was fabulous, street lights had turned on as well.  This is the golden moment to shoot the calm and exciting Rideau Canal.

I raced to the Mackenzie King Bridge, took out the Sony A7R2 which had a Canon EF17-40mm f/4L lens glued to it these days.  Go wide I told myself.  But at 17mm the railing of the bridge got into the frame, 19mm is what I settled at.  Unlike my previous Rideau Canal photos shot from the same location, the Canal was not placed in the centre in this photo to give more room for the drum shaped Shaw Centre.  I bracketed 3 exposures at 1 stop knowing it will capture the entire tonal range of the scene.

The touring boat quietly sneaked into the scene.  Took this shot in a hurry without checking the settings.  Luckily, 4 seconds exposure was not too long for the slowing moving boat.
