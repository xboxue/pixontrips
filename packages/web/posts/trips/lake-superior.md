Lake Superior is the largest fresh water lake by surface area in the world. It has been on my must-see list for a few years. Last summer when Canadian dollar tanked to a mere three quarter of the US counterpart, it becomes a no-brainer destination of our family summer vacation.

It took us twelve hours to get to Lake Superior Provincial Park from Ottawa. That's correct, 900 km in twelve hours, and we were still in the same province, Ontario. You will appreciate the sheer size of Ontario once you embark on trans-Canada road trip, it is a solid two-day drive to cross Ontario from the east to the west.

We spent four days at the Rabbit Blanket Lake campground located at the west end of Lake Superior Provincial Park. The campground is smaller than Agawa Compground, but is much quieter.

Lake Superior could be very rough.  In August, 3 out 5 days are windbound.  We were lucky to have such a calm day that we could paddle in the middle of the lake without "hugging the shore".

Hiking 0.5 km along Agawa Rock Pictographs trail down to the bottom, you will see the pictographs created by the early Ojibwe people.  The horned animal on the cliff face is Misshepezhieu (also known as Mishi Peshu, Mishipashoo, or Great Lynx), which is said to be the spirit of these sacred waters.

It was a hot summer day when we visited the the Old Woman Bay.  The cool breeze, pebble beach, fascinating view and pristine water kept us glued here for an entire day.

From Old Woman Bay across Hwy 17 is the trail head of the Nokomis trails (5.0 km).  At sunset the view from the trail lookout is breathtaking.

After another two and half hours drive further to the north-west, we arrived Pukaskwa National Park.  This is a true wilderness park.  Its beach bears no similarity with any other beaches I have ever seen.

Wawa is a small town between the Lake Superior Provincial Park and Pukaskwa National Park.
