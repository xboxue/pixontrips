We first visited the charming, historic town of Perth, Ontario back in April of this year when it was celebrating its 40th annual Festival of Maples.  You can about that [here](http://pixontrips.com/blogs/perth-celebrates-40th-annual-festival-of-the-maples/).

Yesterday, we were there again to watch the its world record-breaking Kilt Run.  The first ever Perth Kilt Run was held in June of 2010 by a group of volunteers and was supposed to be a one-time-event; however, it attracted thousands of people and has been held annually ever since.  That year, with 1,089, it broke the official previous Guinness World Record of 250 runners.

Filmed at 6:00 pm, the video below shows runners taking off from the start line.  In the background stands the tower of town hall.

I pointed the camera perpendicular to the street to capture the pace of the run and the large number of participants.

During the race, the runners crossed a bridge on Drummond Street, them winded through neighbourhood streets.

A spectator dressed in traditional attire was performing on bagpipe beside the race route, a nice, fitting Scottish touch for the event.

Local residents also played music along the route.

It was 32°C (90°F) in early evening, hot for this part of Canada at the start of summer. In a resourceful fashion, residents used garden hoses to spray the runners, successfully cooling them off.

The run made for a pleasant weekend day trip to Perth - an experience we'd like to repeat next year, hopefully to witness another world record!
