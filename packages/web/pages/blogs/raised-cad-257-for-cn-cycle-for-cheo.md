My legs are a bit stiff after riding 70Km in the [CN Cycle for CHEO event.](http://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/cn-cycle-for-cheo-raises-close-to-1-million-1.2882842)  I have participated in the CN Cycle for many years but this year is special: I raised hundreds of dollars by auctioning the prints made from my photographs.

Five 18"x12" photographs printed from an Epson 9880 inkjet printer by [Jiffy Photo and Print](http://www.jiffyphotoandprint.com/).  After mounted on 3/8 inch MDF boards they look just fantastic.  Both [the Algonquin Provincial Park in Winter](http://pixontrips.com/product/winter-landscape-of-a-wilderness-park-3/) and [the Doyles Waterfalls](http://pixontrips.com/product/water-falls-in-shenandoah-national-park/) show amazing amount of details.  [The John G. Diefenbaker Building](http://pixontrips.com/product/john-g-diefenbaker-building-2/) has such a wide tonal range from deep black to almost pure white.  The colours are so vivid for the [Horseshoe band](http://pixontrips.com/product/horseshoe-bend-at-sunset/).  The [Barron Canyon](http://pixontrips.com/product/fall-colours-in-algonquin-provincial-park/) has a 3D feel, one bidder even thought it is a painting!
