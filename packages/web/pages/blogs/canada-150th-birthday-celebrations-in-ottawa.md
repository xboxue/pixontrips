The down pour in the early morning of July 1st made me hesitant go to downtown Ottawa.  As the rain began to abate, the call from the inside of me became louder and louder.

By 9:30AM when I arrived at the Eagleson Park & Ride, there was already a long line of people waiting in the rain for free shuttle services to go to downtown Ottawa.

After 1:20 hour bus ride, I got off before Elgin Street.  Soon I realized to get close to the Parliament Hill is a mission impossible.

The next few hours were spent on exploring the alternative locations.

I was lucky to get a glimpse of Charles, the Prince of Whales.

Went to the downtown again at night watching the spectacular firework show, which was really the highlight of the 2017 Canada Day.  It was pure luck that the location I was situated at had some open space around me so I could set up a tripod.  Not being able to move, I tried to use different compositions to photograph the fireworks with the National Gallery of Canada as background.
