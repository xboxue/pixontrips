I won't be able to reply each and every comments. Here are some details, hopefully you find them useful.

This photo was taken in the summer of 2013 during a family trip to Utah and Arizona. Horseshoe Band is located in Arizona, the nearest town is Page.

The final photo is a blend of two exposures taken 6 seconds apart. This first exposure was to properly expose the foreground, while the 2nd one attempted to retain the colors in the sky. Lightroom Photo Merge HDR did a great job in blending the two exposures.

Another technique that was used is the LAB color space, something I learned from Marc Muench's book "Exploring North American Landscapes: Visions and Lessons in Digital Photography". For those don't have the book, you can watch his video here: [https://vimeo.com/95137412](https://vimeo.com/95137412)

Other technical details: Camera: EOS 5D Mark II Lens: EF17-40mm f4.0L @17mm Circular polarizer Aperture: f/16 Shutter speed: exposure #1: 1/5", exposure #2: 1/20" ISO: 100 focus: hyperfocal distance. I carried a hyperfocal distance chart.

In Lightroom after the photos were merged and adjusted in LAB color space, clarity was set to 20, vibrance: 20, color saturation: 10.

My photo is an expression of my feeling. Various techniques are tools in my toolbox.

When I saw Horseshoe Band photo this first time, I told myself I want to go this place. Now I'd like to use my photo to tell people: this place is awesome.
