After shooting a red-breasted merganser, I spotted a bird laying in the middle of pond in the Andrew Haydon Park at the west end of Ottawa.

I took a few shots even though I wasn't able to tell what it was.

A lady walking her dog saw me taking photos of the bird and asked if I could see if the bird's feet got stuck in the frozen ice.

"I cannot tell" I told her, handing over my binoculars.  After she looked, both of us believed there was something wrong with the bird and she proceeded to call the city in hopes that someone would come help.

The bird also made calls from time to time, but no one in the family was by.

Then it started looking around, seemingly desperate and calling for help.

Then came a woman by the name of Christine Lamothe and another gentleman Andrew Anderson.  Watch the video I shot while Christine carries out a heroic rescue:

At 9:35AM, Christine sent me an e-mail saying the bird is at Ottawa Wild Bird Care Centre.

P.S.:

The story was featured on Ottawa Citizen and CBC on November 13th.
